# diabetes-prediction-model-using-machine-learning
Diabetes is a common disease and its early 
symptoms are not very noticeable, so an efficient method of 
prediction will help patients make a self-diagnosis. However, the 
conventional method to identify diabetes is to make a blood 
glucose test by doctors and the medical resource is limited. 
Therefore, most patients cannot get the diagnosis immediate
so here we basically develop a diabetes prediction model using various machine learning algorithms
